ML_Kit
======

Online Machine Learning library, coded in R interfaced with HTML/CSS/JavaScript using Shiny. Supports Artificial Neural Network for now. SVM, Naive Bayes, Principal Component Analysis support coming soon. 

###Deployment 
Check out the deployed web app at:

https://umarfarooq360.shinyapps.io/ML_Kit/

####Modifying the Code
Clone the repository. Assuming you have R installed, install the shiny package by running

````
install.packages("shiny")
````
Load the library by running

````
library(shiny)
```
I would recommend using [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) for Shiny apps.
The app works with just two files ui.R and server.R.
Check out the Shiny Documentation for more details.
